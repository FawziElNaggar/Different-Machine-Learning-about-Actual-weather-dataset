# Task 1-a: Classification
1- Load the data and perform all necessary data cleaning and scaling.
2- Data inspection. Use any relevant functions that can help you to understand the data. Use any
necessary visualization techniques to inspect your data
3- Explore the selection of various feature variables for classification. You should include at least
one categorical feature.
4- Classify the data using various classification methods explored in ML1 (logistic regression,
SVC, Decision trees, KNN classifier). Explore using different model parameters in the built-in
sklearn libraries.
5- Explore the use of your own implementations of each Model. Comment on your results.
6- For each model provide suitable quantitative metrics for assessing the performance of your
model based on the required application.

Task 1-b: Regression Analysis
1- Load the data and perform all necessary data cleaning and scaling.
2- Data inspection. Use any relevant functions that can help you to understand the data. Use any
necessary visualization techniques to inspect your data
3- Explore the selection of various feature variables for regression to estimate the income of each
customer. You should include at least one categorical feature.
4- Perform various regression analysis using various methods explored in ML1 (Linear regression,
Multiple regression, SVR regression, Polynomial regression). Explore using different model
parameters in the built-in sklearn libraries.
5- Explore the use of your own implementations of each Model. Comment on your results.
6- For each model provide suitable quantitative metrics for assessing the performance of your
model based on the required application.
